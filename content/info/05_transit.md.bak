Hong Kong's public transportation is very convenient and easy to use. In addition to cash, you can pay for the majority of 
public transportation with an Octopus card.

### Octopus Card 

The Octopus Card a cash-equivalent, rechargeable RFID card for nearly all public transit. It is also accepted at convenience stores, supermarkets, vending machines, and some restaurants. There are two main kinds of Octopus Card for adults. Children (ages 3-11) and seniors (aged 65+) can enjoy discounts on their travels. 

#### Standard Octopus Card 

* $150 HKD: $50 HKD refundable deposit, $100 HKD cash value 
* Allows a one-time negative value up to $35 HKD for transit. Once the card goes negative, it cannot be used until it's refilled
* You can get the refundable deposit and any loaded cash values back, minus a $9 HKD adminstrative fee if the card is less than 3 months old
* Available as children (age 3-11) and senior (65+) versions
* You can buy a card at MTR customer service centers, including the one at the airport, but they might sell out.
* This card is best if you take the time to get the refundable deposit at the end of your trip.
