### Wifi
HK airport has free wifi available.  

### SIM card purchase 
Hong Kong's cell coverage is very good.  Pre-paid SIM card is available at HKG airport. 

Convenience stores such as 7-11, Circle K, and VanGo offer SIM card and reload voucher.  

To use a pre-paid SIM card, you must have a GSM-based unlocked phone.  Talk to your neighborhood tech guys for details if you need assistance.  

HK airport arrival hall A13 kiosk sells SIM card and a variety of tour packages.  
Buy online ahead of arrival and pick up at [A13 kiosk](https://www.klook.com/activity/727-hongkong-one2free-3g-sim-card-hongkong/)
The representatives at the kiosk will help you set up your phone.  We recommend getting your SIM this way.
