### Hong Kong Geography
 																				
Hong Kong consists of 2 main land masses, which are divided into 3 areas: 					

* Hong Kong Island
* Kowloon (peninsula off the southern part of New Territory)
* New Territory (rest of Hong Kong)

There are also 100s of outlying islands. The airport is located on one of the largest. The north side of New Territory connects to mainland China, separated by a river.

To minimize transit time, we recommend that you stay in the Kowloon area.  If you prefer to stay in New Territory, stay as close to an MTR line as possible. We do not recommend staying north of Sha Tin, or North/West of Lai King if you decide to stay in New Territory. The better lodging area is marked with a Yellow Polygon on the map.

Lodging on Hong Kong Island is very popular with tourists. However, you must go across the harbor to access the rest of Hong Kong.  The cost of cross-harbor trips are typically higher.  Please keep this in mind if you decide to stay on Hong Kong Island.				

Certain aparement sharing sites provide listings in Shenzhen when searching for lodging in Hong Kong. We <b>ABSOLUTELY DO NOT RECOMMEND staying in Shenzhen</b>, as it is on mainland China side. You will need to go across the border each day to access Hong Kong. Areas north of the Red Line on the map are in Shenzhen.

### Hong Kong Housing

Hong Kong housing is known to be quite small world-wide.  Even if the unit features several bedrooms, they are likely to be very small.  Keep in mind that a 1,000 sqft apartment is considered a luxury, and not a norm. Please adjust your expectations accordingly. 

Hong Kong's noise and light pollution are worse than the majority of the cities in US or Europe. If you need absolute darkness and silence to sleep, please make sure to bring earplugs and eye mask.

There is at least one mall and food establishments nearby most lodging locations in Hong Kong-- enjoy the convenience!
