### Wifi
HKG airport has free wifi.

### SIM card purchase
Hong Kong's cell coverage is very good. Pre-paid SIM cards are available at the HKG airport. 

Convenience stores such as 7-11, Circle K, and VanGo offer SIM cards and reload vouchers.  

To use a pre-paid SIM card, you must have a GSM-based unlocked phone. Talk to your neighborhood tech guys for details if you need assistance.  

The HKG airport arrival hall A13 kiosk sells SIM cards and a variety of tour packages. Buy online ahead of your arrival and pick up at [A13 kiosk](https://www.klook.com/activity/727-hongkong-one2free-3g-sim-card-hongkong/). The representatives at the kiosk will help you set up your phone. We recommend getting your SIM this way.
